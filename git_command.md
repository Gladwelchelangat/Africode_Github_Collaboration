Sure, here are all Git commands with detailed explanations:

1. `git clone <repository_url>`: This command creates a copy of an existing Git repository from a remote server. It downloads the entire repository, including all its history and branches.

2. `git branch <branch_name>`: This command creates a new branch in your local repository. Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.

3. `git checkout <branch_name>`: This command switches your working directory to the specified branch. All your changes will now be made on this branch.

4. `git checkout -b <branch_name>`: This command creates a new branch and switches to it in one step. It's a shorthand for running `git branch <branch_name>` followed by `git checkout <branch_name>`.

5. `git add <file_name>`: This command adds a file to the staging area. The staging area is a temporary area where you can prepare your changes before committing them to the repository.

6. `git commit -m "<commit_message>"`: This command creates a new commit in your local repository. A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time, along with a message describing the changes made.

7. `git push <remote_name> <branch_name>`: This command pushes your local commits to a remote repository. The remote repository is typically hosted on a server, such as GitHub or GitLab.

8. `git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>`: This command fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into your local repository. It updates your local branch with the latest changes from the remote branch.

9. `git merge <branch_name>`: This command merges the specified branch into the current branch. It combines the changes from the specified branch into the current branch, creating a new commit if necessary.

10. `git rebase <branch_name>`: This command reapplies your commits on top of another branch. It's a way to integrate changes from one branch into another without creating a merge commit.

11. `git log`: This command shows the commit history of your repository. It displays a list of commits, including their commit hashes, authors, dates, and commit messages.

12. `git diff <commit_hash_1> <commit_hash_2>`: This command shows the differences between two commits. It compares the changes made in each commit and displays them in a human-readable format.

13. `git reset`: This command resets the staging area to match the latest commit. It removes any changes that have been added to the staging area but not yet committed.

14. `git checkout -- <file_name>`: This command discards changes in a file. It reverts the file to its state in the last commit.

15. `git rm --cached <file_name>`: This command removes a file from the staging area but keeps it in the working directory. It's useful when you want to remove a file from version control but still keep it on your local machine.

16. `git rm <file_name>`: This command removes a file from both the staging area and the working directory. It's useful when you want to remove a file from version control and delete it from your local machine.

17. `git mv <old_file_name> <new_file_name>`: This command renames a file. It moves the file to the new name in the staging area and updates the repository accordingly.

18. `git stash`: This command temporarily stores changes in the staging area. It creates a new stash, which is a stack of changes that can be applied later.

19. `git stash apply`: This command applies the changes from the last stash to the current branch. It restores the stashed changes to the staging area and working directory.

20. `git stash drop`: This command removes the last stash from the stack. It discards the changes without applying them to the current branch.

These are just a few of the Git commands available. There are many more advanced commands and features that can help you manage your projects more efficiently.
